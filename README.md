Introducing Malaysia’s very own game, ‘Roll On’. This game portrays the essence of Malaysia. It showcases the vast diversity of cultures that we are blessed with. Level 1 shows our obsessive love for food. We are always united in our love of food. There is no denying that Malaysians and food go hand in hand, so it’s easy to see why our country is such a gastronomic delight for any foodie. In Level 1, one is to collect Malaysian’s favorite dishes such as Nasi Lemak, Teh Tarik and Ketupat. The level one game platform is surrounded by palm trees which plays an important part in Malaysia’s economy. Level 2 shows the flags of 13 Malaysian States and Wilayah Persekutuan. By playing this level, one will be able to recognize the flags and learn about each state of Malaysia. Is also reflects our love of travelling within our beautiful and scenic country. The level 2 game platform is surrounded by modern buildings and infrastructure which denotes Malaysia’s rapid development since Merdeka. Level 3 is all about our rich traditions and our cultures. We have to collect our national flower ‘Bunga Raya’ and national bird ‘Burung Kenyalang’. We also have to collect ‘Wau Bulan’ and ‘Gasing Piring’ which are marvelous tradition passed from generation to generation. The level 3 game platform is surrounded by Malaysia’s natural greeneries and tropical rainforest, which is one of the world’s richest biodiversity. Overall, not only this game encourages players to appreciate Malaysia’s beauty, but it also enhances a player’s motor and strategical thinking skills.

## Inspiration
This project is made by 3 Malaysian students currently pursuing their studies in the US. We tried to look up if there are any games about Malaysia’s rich culture and diversity, but unfortunately, we failed to find any. It was when we found this hackathon that we said to ourselves, “Hey this is the perfect opportunity to polish up our game development skills and also to spread awareness to others about our motherland’s beauty!”

## What it does
Players have to collect collectibles on each level before the timer runs out to win the level and go to the next level. There is a slight increase in difficulty for every new level, such as shortened timer, new obstacles or challenges and so on.

## How we built it
We learned the basics by following a tutorial on Unity, as we had no prior experience in Unity Game Development, and we tried to make a simple doable game using C# and Unity.

## Challenges we ran into
It was hard finding 3D models that were on public domain, but we managed to scrap by (Yay!) The time constraints and finding support when we were stuck were also one of the major challenges that we often ran into.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We believe that this game truly captures the spirit of Malaysia, and we are proud of that!

## What we learned
Unity game development and time management skills.

## What's next for Roll On!
We are planning to add more features and level in the future, and improve the existing ones!
